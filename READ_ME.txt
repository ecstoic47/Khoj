Assalamualikum and Good Day!

This is a complete project as per your instruction.

I used MongoDB, Express js, React js, Node js (MERN) to complete this project

I tried my best to keep my code clean so that it is readable and I provided comments where necessary.

To run this commnet

Download or clone the project named Khoj_the_Search from my gitHub repository.

Open the Project with an editor

It has two sub folders named frontend and backend


For Frontend:


1. Open Terminal and cd to frontend then Write yarn (you need to have yarn installed or you can use npm install)

2. It will install all the necessary libraries

3. Double check you are on frontend 

4. Write yarn start or npm start to run the frontend on browser. It should start on port 3000 if not occupied.


For Backend:

1.Go to backend using terminal and write yarn or npm install to install all the libraries.

2.Then write nodemon app.js or node app.js to start the backend server. It should start on post 5000 if not occupied


For GET API call please go to postmant and type localhost:5000/api/save/ in the url section

Provide id, start_datetime and end_datetime in the params 

values in the params should not contain "" 

Thank you.
